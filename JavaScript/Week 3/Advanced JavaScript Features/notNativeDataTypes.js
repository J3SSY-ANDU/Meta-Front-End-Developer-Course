// Other data structures in JavaScript
// Besides the built-in data structures in JavaScript, it's possible to build non-native, custom data structures.
// These data structures come built-in natively in some other programming languages  or even those other programming languages don't support them natively.
// Some more advanced data structures that have not been covered include:
//     Queues
//     Linked lists (singly-linked and doubly-linked)
//     Trees
//     Graphs
// For resources on building these data structures, please refer to the additional reading
