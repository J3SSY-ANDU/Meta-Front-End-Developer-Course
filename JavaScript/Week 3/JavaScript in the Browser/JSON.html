    <!-- JSON is just a string - but there are rules that it must follow

These values include:

    primitive values: strings, numbers, bolleans, null

    complex values: objects and arrays (no functions!)

    Objects have double-quoted strings for all keys

    Properties are comma-delimited both in JSON objects and in JSON arrays, just like in regular JavaScript code

    String properties must be surrounded in double quotes. For example:

     

    "fruits",

     

    "vegetables"

    Number properties are represented using the regular JavaScript number syntax; e.g

     

    5,

     

    10,

     

    1.2

    Boolean properties are represented using the regular JavaScript boolean syntax, that is:

     

    true

     

    and

     

    false

    Null as a property is the same as in regular JavaScript; it's just a

     

    null

You can use object literals and array literals, as long as you follow the above rules

What happens if you try to stringify a data type which is not accepted in JSON syntax?

For example, what if you try to stringify a function? The operation will silently fail.

If you try to stringify some other data types, such as a BigInt number, say 123n, you'd get the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt. -->
